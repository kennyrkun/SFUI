SFUI -- Simple Fast User Interface

SFUI is an interface system based on [Widgets](https://www.github.com/abodelot/sfml-widgets/) using [SFML](https://www.github.com/SFML/SFML)

  
  
Usage:

Link SFUI to your project.

include the `SFUI.hpp` header and you should be including everything you need.

Or alternatively, #include only the files you need, such as `Button.hpp`. Every widget can be used on their own, or in layouts as a system.
